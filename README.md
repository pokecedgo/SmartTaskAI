# SmartTaskAI

A dynamic AI-powered assistant using the GEMINI API that functions as a chatbot while seamlessly integrating with a visual to-do list, allowing users to manage tasks, create plans, and generate structured routines like gym splits through natural conversation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chat**: Interact with an AI assistant to get responses to your queries.
- **To-Do List Creation**: Automatically generate to-do lists based on your input, such as creating a 7-day gym split or planning your tasks for the week.
- **Rate Limiting**: Ensures fair usage by limiting the number of requests per minute.
